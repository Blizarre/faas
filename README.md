# Performance

Using [baton](https://github.com/americanexpress/baton), my 4-cores arm server in oracle cloud managed to serve requests at a peak 400'000 requests per minutes from my home laptop:

```
$ ./baton -c 200 -r 100000 -u https://faas.marache.net
Configuring to send GET requests to: https://faas.marache.net
Generating the requests...

====================== Results ======================
Total requests:                                100000
Time taken to complete requests:        18.062498286s
Requests per second:                             5536
===================== Breakdown =====================
```

That should be good enough for now.
